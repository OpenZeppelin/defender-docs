= Defender

OpenZeppelin Defender is a mission-critical developer security platform to *code*, *audit*, *deploy*, *monitor*, and *operate* blockchain applications with confidence.

Integrating directly into the developer workflow, Defender makes it easy and fast for developers and operators to prevent and fix security issues pre and post-deployment.

Defender offers flexible subscriptions to match your team’s needs and support your project at any scale.

- *Builder (Free)* - Suitable for individuals and small projects that are getting started on testnets and need access to all basic features with limited quotas.
- *Professional* - For mature projects running on mainnets that need access to premium features, higher quotas and metered billing, as well as access to OpenZeppelin support and SLA.
- *Enterprise* - For large projects with higher volumes that need a custom plan to meet their project needs, with higher quotas, access to all premium and security features, and a dedicated support channel.
