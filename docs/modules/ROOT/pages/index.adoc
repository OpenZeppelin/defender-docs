= Defender

OpenZeppelin Defender is a mission-critical developer security platform to *code*, *audit*, *deploy*, *monitor*, and *operate* blockchain applications with confidence.

Integrating directly into the developer workflow, Defender makes it easy and fast for developers and operators to prevent and fix security issues pre and post-deployment.

IMPORTANT: Defender legacy is now deprecated in favor of Defender. Learn how to migrate xref:migration.adoc[here]! *On June 1st 2024, you will no longer have access to Defender 1.0 UI and API*.
