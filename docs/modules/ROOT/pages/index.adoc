[[sign-up]]
== Signing up

Signing up to Defender is free! Just head over to [defender.openzeppelin.com](https://defender.openzeppelin.com/), hit Sign In, and choose to create a new account. After verifying your email address, you will be redirected to your own Defender account on the free plan. See below for how to invite more users to your team!

[[user-management]]
== User management and shared access

Access to all resources in Defender is shared across all users in your team. This means that every Relayer or Autotask you have created will also be accessible by any of your team members â€” there is no concept of user-based ownership.

You can review your team members under the Collaborators section, accessible from the top-right user menu. You can also invite new users to your team from there. A user can only belong to a single team in Defender (for now).

WARNING: If you want to add a user to your team, make sure to invite them from the Collaborators section. If they sign up directly to the application, they will be added to a new team of their own instead. If this happens, contact us at [defender@openzeppelin.com](mailto:defender@openzeppelin.com) and we'll help.

[[tiers]]
=== Tiers and quotas

The Defender free plan is restricted for testnet access only. In addition, you may only create up to five Relayers and Autotasks, import up to five Contracts into Admin, and have up to five Users in your team. The total number of transactions sent from Relayers cannot exceed 30 per hour, and the same limit applies for Autotask runs.

If you want access to mainnet or to increase any of the quota limits from the free plan, please apply via [this form](https://openzeppelin.com/apply/) and we'll reach out to you.
