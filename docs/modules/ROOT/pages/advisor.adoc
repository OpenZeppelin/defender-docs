Not all the security best practices in Defender Advisor are relevant for all projects. Use discretion in determining which best practices are relevant according to your project details.

[[coming-up...]]
== Coming up...

We will soon add the ability for you to track your usage of individual security best practices and to use that tracking information to assess your overall security risk and compare your project to the overall population of Defender users. Also, we intend to allow Defender users to customize the knowledgebase with their own additional security best practices. Finally, we will continue to enhance the knowledgebase quarterly as new best practices are discovered and defined. As always, please let us know if you have any other requests!
