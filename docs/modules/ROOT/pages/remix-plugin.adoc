When coding and compiling contracts from https://remix.ethereum.org/[Remix IDE, window=_blank], you can use Defender Plugin to deploy your contracts by configuring a xref:module/deploy.adoc[Deployment Environment] and using an Approval Process as deployer.

[[usage]]
== Usage


[[api-key-generation]]
=== API Key generation
In your Defender dashboard, go to *Settings -> API Keys* and click *Create API Key*, you only need _Manage Deployments_ permission.

WARNING: We also recommend to set an expiration for the API Key, considering that is going to be used from an external site.

[[approval-process]]
==== Approval Process
Here you have 3 options:

- Select an existing approval process from your *Deployment Environment* configured for the selected network.

NOTE: If you have an existing deployment environment in the selected network, this is the only option allowed.

- If the *Deployment Envoronment* does not exist for the selected network, then you can create a new one. 

NOTE: If the Approval Process to be created is a Relayer, the API Key must include _Manage Relayers_ permission.

- Additionally, you can use the *injected provider* from Remix (a browser wallet) to deploy the contract, this will create a Defender *Deployment Environment* under the hood after deploying the contract.

[[deploy]]
==== Deploy
You should see the latest compiled contract along with the constructor inputs.

NOTE: In case you don't see it, compile the target contract again, the Defender plug-in should detect the compilation and display the contructor inputs.
