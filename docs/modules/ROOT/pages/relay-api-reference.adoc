[[relay-api]]
= Relay API Reference

The Relay API is split into 2 modules:

1. Relay Client

* Execute create, read, and update operations across all relayers within an account
* Authenticates with bearer token generated using Team API Key/Secret (available when Team API Key is created)

2. Relay Signer

* Execute send, sign, and other operations using a specific relayer
* Authenticates with bearer token generated using Relayer API Key/Secret (available when relayer is created)

For more information on authentication, refer to the xref:api-auth.adoc[authentication section].

NOTE: You can use the https://www.npmjs.com/package/defender-relay-client[defender-relay-client] npm package for simplifying interactions with the Relay API.

[[relay-client-module]]
== Relay Client Module Reference

The Relay Client Module exposes the following endpoints: 

- `list`: list all relayers associated with the account
- `create`: create a new relayer
- `retrieve`: retrieve data for a single relayer
- `update`: update an existing relayer

[[list-endpoint]]
=== List Relayers

To list existing relayers, you can call the `list` function on the client, which returns a `ListRelayerResponse` object:

```js
await client.list();
```

The `relayers/summary` endpoint is used to retrieve a list of existing relayers via a `GET` request.

```
curl \
  -X GET \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "X-Api-Key: $KEY" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
    "https://defender-api.openzeppelin.com/relayers/summary"
```

An example response:

```js
[
    {
      relayerId: '201832e2-c612-4283-97c5-31849242c1fe',
      name: 'MyRelayer',
      address: '0x623e258760220127d4856fa24ff126a230560749',
      network: 'rinkeby',
      createdAt: '2022-04-05T16:57:37.154Z',
      paused: false,
      policies: {},
      minBalance: '100000000000000000',
      pendingTxCost: '0'
    }
]
```

[[list-keys-endpoint]]
=== List Relayer Keys

To list keys associated with an existing relayer, you can call the `listKeys` function with a `relayerId` on the client, which returns an array of `RelayerKey` objects:

```js
await client.listKeys('58b3d255-e357-4b0d-aa16-e86f745e63b9');
```

The `/relayers/${relayerId}/keys` endpoint is used to retrieve a list of relayer keys via a `GET` request.

```
curl \
  -X GET \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "X-Api-Key: $KEY" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
    "https://defender-api.openzeppelin.com/relayers/58b3d255-e357-4b0d-aa16-e86f745e63b9/keys"
```

An example response:

```js
[
    {
      apiKey: '5Kk12pMA6LjPSppaRAsfAJRAjYeFJzr6',
      createdAt: '2022-04-26T19:49:10.292Z',
      relayerId: '58b3d255-e357-4b0d-aa16-e86f745e63b9',
      keyId: '898a952b-415b-4d4b-882b-3958f11pbeea'
  }
]
```

[[create-endpoint]]
=== Create Relayers

To create a new relayer, you need to provide the parameters as described directly below in interface `CreateRelayerRequest`.

```js
interface CreateRelayerRequest {
  name: string;
  useAddressFromRelayerId?: string;
  network: Network;
  minBalance: string;
  policies?: UpdateRelayerPoliciesRequest;
}

interface UpdateRelayerPoliciesRequest {
  gasPriceCap?: string;
  whitelistReceivers?: string[];
}

include::partial$network.adoc[]
```

Using the `defender-relay-client` package:

```js
const requestParameters = {
  name: 'MyNewRelayer',
  network: 'rinkeby',
  minBalance: BigInt(1e17).toString(),
  policies: {
    whitelistReceivers: ['0xAb5801a7D398351b8bE11C439e05C5B3259aeC9B'],
  },
};

await client.create(requestParameters);
```

You can also clone an existing relayer to a different network by referencing an existing `relayerId` in the `useAddressFromRelayerId` parameter:

```js
const requestParameters = {
  name: 'MyClonedRelayer',
  useAddressFromRelayerId: '201832e2-c612-4283-97c5-31849242c1fe',
  network: 'mainnet',
  minBalance: BigInt(1e17).toString()
};

await client.create(requestParameters);
```

Making a POST request to the `/relayers` endpoint:

```
curl \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "X-Api-Key: $KEY" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{...}' \
    "https://defender-api.openzeppelin.com/relayers"
```

[[relayer-policies]]
==== Relayer Policies

The following relayer policies may be optionally included in both create and update calls:

* `gasPriceCap`: Maximum gas price in wei
* `whitelistReceivers`: an array of all valid addresses with which this relayer can interact; the relayer can send transactions to any address if this policy is undefined.

[[create-key-endpoint]]
=== Create Relayer Key

A relayer created via the API will not have any associated relayer keys by default. To create one, you can call the `createKey` method on the client, which returns a `RelayerKey` (including the `secretKey` - available on creation only):

```js

await client.createKey('58b3d255-e357-4b0d-aa16-e86f745e63b9');
```

Making a POST request to the `/relayers/${relayerId}/keys` endpoint:

```
curl \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "X-Api-Key: $KEY" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
    "https://defender-api.openzeppelin.com/relayers/58b3d255-e357-4b0d-aa16-e86f745e63b9/keys"
```

An example response:

```js
[
    {
      apiKey: '5Kk12pMA6LjPSppaRAsfAJRAjYeFJzr6',
      createdAt: '2022-04-26T19:49:10.292Z',
      relayerId: '58b3d255-e357-4b0d-aa16-e86f745e63b9',
      keyId: '898a952b-415b-4d4b-882b-3958f11pbeea',
      secretKey: '1pDxUoWYtrAK4xMsKmOITpd1PQofWDFRRTNp2jshDhZ1XhYxDCfAvQ5vyKprFhXQ'
  }
]
```

[[update-endpoint]]
=== Update Relayers

To update a relayer, you can call the `update` function on the client. This will require the relayer ID and a `UpdateRelayerRequest` object as parameters:

```js
interface UpdateRelayerRequest {
  name?: string;
  minBalance?: string;
  policies?: UpdateRelayerPoliciesRequest;
}
```

Using the `defender-relay-client` package:

```js
await client.update('201832e2-c612-4283-97c5-31849242c1fe', { name: 'My Updated Name' });
```

Making a PUT request to the `/relayers` endpoint:

```
curl \
  -X PUT \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "X-Api-Key: $KEY" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{...}' \
    "https://defender-api.openzeppelin.com/relayers"
```

NOTE: If making the request directly (not with `defender-relay-client`), any policy updates will need to be made via requests to the endpoint directly below with a body type of `UpdateRelayerPoliciesRequest`.

```
curl \
  -X PUT \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "X-Api-Key: $KEY" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{...}' \
    "https://defender-api.openzeppelin.com/relayers/{relayerId}"
```

[[delete-key-endpoint]]
=== Delete Relayer Key

To delete a key associated with a relayer, you can call the `deleteKey` method on the client, which returns a message indicating deletion status:

```js

await client.deleteKey('58b3d255-e357-4b0d-aa16-e86f745e63b9', 'j3bru93-k32l-3p1s-pp56-u43f675e92p1');
```

NOTE: The second argument to `deleteKey` is the `keyId`, not the `apiKey`. One way to differentiate the two is the `keyId` contains hyphens. This can be fetched via the list operation described above and is also available in the response on key creation.

Making a DELETE request to the `/relayers/${relayerId}/keys/${keyId}` endpoint:

```
curl \
  -X DELETE \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "X-Api-Key: $KEY" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
    "https://defender-api.openzeppelin.com/relayers/58b3d255-e357-4b0d-aa16-e86f745e63b9/keys/j3bru93-k32l-3p1s-pp56-u43f675e92p1"
```

An example response:

```js
{
  message: 'j3bru93-k32l-3p1s-pp56-u43f675e92p1 deleted'
}
```

Deletion of a relayer (not just a key) is only available via the Defender console.

[[relay-signer-module]]
== Relayer Signer Module Reference

The Relayer Signer Module exposes the following endpoints: 

- `txs`: send transactions to the Ethereum blockchain and query their status 
- `sign`: sign arbitrary data with relayer's private key
- `relayer`: retrieve information from the relayer
- `jsonrpc`: make json-rpc calls to the Ethereum network

[[txs-endpoint]]
=== Transactions Endpoint

The `/txs` endpoint is used for both sending transactions and for retrieving transaction information given a transaction identifier.

[[send-transaction]]
==== Send Transaction
To send a transaction to the Ethereum blockchain submit a `POST` request with the desired payload. The payload format is as follows:

```TypeScript
type Address = string;
type BigUInt = string | number;
type Hex = string;
type Speed = 'safeLow' | 'average' | 'fast' | 'fastest';

interface SendTransactionRequest {
  to: Address;
  value?: BigUInt; // optional
  data?: Hex; // optional 
  speed?: Speed; // optional
  gasPrice?: BigUInt; // optional
  validUntil?: string; // optional
  gasLimit: BigUInt;
}
```
An example of the request:

```bash
DATA='{ "to": "0x179810822f56b0e79469189741a3fa5f2f9a7631", "value": "1", "speed": "fast", "gasLimit": "21000" }'

curl \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "X-Api-Key: $KEY" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d "$DATA" \
    "https://api.defender.openzeppelin.com/txs"
```

You would receive a response in the following format:

```TypeScript
type Address = string;
type BigUInt = string | number;
type Hex = string;
type Speed = 'safeLow' | 'average' | 'fast' | 'fastest';
type Status = 'pending' | 'sent' | 'submitted' | 'inmempool' | 'mined' | 'confirmed' | 'failed';

interface TransactionResponse {
  transactionId: string;
  hash: string;
  to: Address;
  from: Address;
  value: string;
  data: string;
  speed: Speed;
  gasPrice: number;
  gasLimit: number;
  nonce: number;
  status: Status;
  chainId: number;
  validUntil: string;
}
```

Note the extra `transactionId` field, which is an internal Defender identifier for the transaction, which is used for querying and replacing.

[[transaction-status]]
==== Transaction Status
Every transaction response will have an status assigned depending on the last time the backend has seen it. Each time Defender monitors a transaction, the status might be updated.

The available status and their corresponding description are the following:

WARNING: Status `pending`, `sent` and `submitted` are subject to be merged in the future. Avoid to rely on them since backwards compatibility is not assured. 

```Typescript
type Status =
  /**
   * Temporary pre-sent status.
   * The transaction has been received but not yet signed.
   */
  | 'pending'
  /**
   * Sent to queue.
   * The transaction is already signed, enqueued and waiting to be broadcasted to the network.
   */
  | 'sent'
  /**
   * Transaction broadcasted.
   * The transaction has been broadcasted to the network providers.
   */
  | 'submitted'
  /**
   * Seen on mempool.
   * It's confirmed that the transaction is in the mempool of at least one of the nodes of the network.
   */
  | 'inmempool'
  /**
   * Transaction mined.
   * A mined block has included the transaction.
   */
  | 'mined'
  /**
   * Enough confirmations passed.
   * The transaction has being kept in a mined block after N new mined blocks, where N depends on the chain.
   */
  | 'confirmed'
  /**
   * Terminal failure.
   * The transaction couldn't get processed for unexpected reasons.
   */
  | 'failed';
```

[[replace-transaction]]
==== Replace Transaction
To replace a `pending` transaction make a `PUT` request to the `txs` endpoint with the Defender `transactionId` or `nonce`, *not* with the transaction hash.

An example of the request:

```bash
curl \
  -X PUT \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "X-Api-Key: $KEY" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d "$DATA" \
    "https://api.defender.openzeppelin.com/txs/$IDorNONCE"
```

The request payload and the response are the same as that of sending a transaction.

[[query-transaction]]
==== Query Transaction
To retrieve a transaction status and data make a `GET` request to the `txs` endpoint with the Defender `transactionId`, *not* with the transaction hash.

An example of the request:

```bash
curl \
  -X GET \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "X-Api-Key: $KEY" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
    "https://api.defender.openzeppelin.com/txs/$ID"
```

An example of the response:

```JSON
{
   "chainId":4,
   "hash":"0xcef95469a9f02757f0968ec8c11449ae5e7486073075381dcd62bacec9e5d627",
   "transactionId":"affba150-e563-441e-ae49-04bd6050979a",
   "value":"0x1",
   "gasPrice":1000000000,
   "gasLimit":21000,
   "to":"0x179810822f56b0e79469189741a3fa5f2f9a7631",
   "from":"0xbce0b5b71668e42d908e387b68dba91789c932b8",
   "data":"0x",
   "nonce":160,
   "status":"mined",
   "speed":"fast"
}
```

[[list-transactions]]
==== List Transactions
To retrieve a list of recent transactions sent from your relayer, make a `GET` request to the `txs`. You can optionally set `since`, `limit`, and `status` (`mined`, `pending`, or `failed`) as query parameters.

An example of the request:

```bash
curl \
  -X GET \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "X-Api-Key: $KEY" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
    "https://api.defender.openzeppelin.com/txs?status=pending&limit=5"
```

An example of the response:

```JSON
[{
   "chainId":4,
   "hash":"0xcef95469a9f02757f0968ec8c11449ae5e7486073075381dcd62bacec9e5d627",
   "transactionId":"affba150-e563-441e-ae49-04bd6050979a",
   "value":"0x1",
   "gasPrice":1000000000,
   "gasLimit":21000,
   "to":"0x179810822f56b0e79469189741a3fa5f2f9a7631",
   "from":"0xbce0b5b71668e42d908e387b68dba91789c932b8",
   "data":"0x",
   "nonce":160,
   "status":"mined",
   "speed":"fast"
}]
```

[[sign-endpoint]]
=== Sign Endpoint
To sign arbitrary messages according to the https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-191[EIP-191 Standard] (prefixed by `\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\n`) with your Relay private key make a `POST` request to `/sign` with a payload containing the hex string to sign. The payload format is:
