[[relay-api]]
= Relay API Reference

The Relay API exposes the following endpoints: 

- `txs`: send transactions to the Ethereum blockchain and query their status 
- `sign`: sign arbitrary data with relayer's private key
- `relayer`: retrieve information from the relayer
- `jsonrpc`: make json-rpc calls to the Ethereum network

All requests need to be authenticated with a bearer token, which is generated using a Relayer API Key. Refer to the xref:api-auth.adoc[authentication section] for info on how to negotiate it.

NOTE: You can use the https://www.npmjs.com/package/defender-relay-client[defender-relay-client] npm package for simplifying interactions with the Relay API.

[[txs-endpoint]]
== Transactions Endpoint

The `/txs` endpoint is used for both sending transactions and for retrieving transaction information given a transaction identifier.

[[send-transaction]]
=== Send Transaction
To send a transaction to the Ethereum blockchain submit a `POST` request with the desired payload. The payload format is as follows:

```TypeScript
type Address = string;
type BigUInt = string | number;
type Hex = string;
type Speed = 'safeLow' | 'average' | 'fast' | 'fastest';

interface SendTransactionRequest {
  to: Address;
  value?: BigUInt; // optional
  data?: Hex; // optional 
  speed?: Speed; // optional
  gasPrice?: BigUInt; // optional
  validUntil?: string; // optional
  gasLimit: BigUInt;
}
```
An example of the request:

```bash
DATA='{ "to": "0x179810822f56b0e79469189741a3fa5f2f9a7631", "value": "1", "speed": "fast", "gasLimit": "21000" }'

curl \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "X-Api-Key: $KEY" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d "$DATA" \
    "https://api.defender.openzeppelin.com/txs"
```

You would receive a response in the following format:

```TypeScript
type Address = string;
type BigUInt = string | number;
type Hex = string;
type Speed = 'safeLow' | 'average' | 'fast' | 'fastest';
type Status = 'pending' | 'sent' | 'submitted' | 'inmempool' | 'mined' | 'confirmed';

interface TransactionResponse {
  transactionId: string;
  hash: string;
  to: Address;
  from: Address;
  value: string;
  data: string;
  speed: Speed;
  gasPrice: number;
  gasLimit: number;
  nonce: number;
  status: Status;
  chainId: number;
  validUntil: string;
}
```

Note the extra `transactionId` field, which is an internal Defender identifier for the transaction, which is used for querying and replacing.

[[replace-transaction]]
=== Replace Transaction
To replace a `pending` transaction make a `PUT` request to the `txs` endpoint with the Defender `transactionId` or `nonce`, *not* with the transaction hash.

An example of the request:

```bash
curl \
  -X PUT \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "X-Api-Key: $KEY" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d "$DATA" \
    "https://api.defender.openzeppelin.com/txs/$IDorNONCE"
```

The request payload and the response are the same as that of sending a transaction.

[[query-transaction]]
=== Query Transaction
To retrieve a transaction status and data make a `GET` request to the `txs` endpoint with the Defender `transactionId`, *not* with the transaction hash.

An example of the request:

```bash
curl \
  -X GET \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "X-Api-Key: $KEY" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
    "https://api.defender.openzeppelin.com/txs/$ID"
```

An example of the response:

```JSON
{
   "chainId":4,
   "hash":"0xcef95469a9f02757f0968ec8c11449ae5e7486073075381dcd62bacec9e5d627",
   "transactionId":"affba150-e563-441e-ae49-04bd6050979a",
   "value":"0x1",
   "gasPrice":1000000000,
   "gasLimit":21000,
   "to":"0x179810822f56b0e79469189741a3fa5f2f9a7631",
   "from":"0xbce0b5b71668e42d908e387b68dba91789c932b8",
   "data":"0x",
   "nonce":160,
   "status":"mined",
   "speed":"fast"
}
```

[[list-transactions]]
=== List Transactions
To retrieve a list of recent transactions sent from your relayer, make a `GET` request to the `txs`. You can optionally set `since`, `limit`, and `status` (`mined`, `pending`, or `failed`) as query parameters.

An example of the request:

```bash
curl \
  -X GET \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "X-Api-Key: $KEY" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
    "https://api.defender.openzeppelin.com/txs?status=pending&limit=5"
```

An example of the response:

```JSON
[{
   "chainId":4,
   "hash":"0xcef95469a9f02757f0968ec8c11449ae5e7486073075381dcd62bacec9e5d627",
   "transactionId":"affba150-e563-441e-ae49-04bd6050979a",
   "value":"0x1",
   "gasPrice":1000000000,
   "gasLimit":21000,
   "to":"0x179810822f56b0e79469189741a3fa5f2f9a7631",
   "from":"0xbce0b5b71668e42d908e387b68dba91789c932b8",
   "data":"0x",
   "nonce":160,
   "status":"mined",
   "speed":"fast"
}]
```
