= Autotask API Reference

The Autotask API allows you to programmatically upload new code to any of your Autotasks.

Requests need to be authenticated with a bearer token, which is negotiated from the Team API Key with the corresponding capability. Refer to the xref:api-auth.adoc[authentication section] for info on how to negotiate it.

NOTE: We recommend you use the https://www.npmjs.com/package/defender-autotask-client[defender-autotask-client] npm package for simplifying interactions with the Autotask API.

[[code-endpoint]]
== Update Code Endpoint

The `autotasks/{id}/code` endpoint is used for uploading new Autotask code via a `PUT` request. The endpoint accepts a JSON object with an `encodedZippedCode` property, which corresponds to the base64-encoded zip file with the code bundle.

```bash
zip -r code.zip index.js

curl \
  -X PUT \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "X-Api-Key: $KEY" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d "{ \"encodedZippedCode\": \"$(cat code.zip | base64 -w0)\" }" \
    "https://defender-api.openzeppelin.com/autotask/autotasks/${AUTOTASKID}/code"
```

NOTE: You can include multiple files in the bundle, as long as the bundle does not exceed 50MB in size, and you include an `index.js` at the root of the zip file to act as entrypoint.
