[[migration]]
= Migrating from Defender legacy

IMPORTANT: *On June 1st 2024, you will no longer have access to Defender legacy UI and API*. 

With the announcement of Defender general availability, we are deprecating Defender legacy (also known as legacy) in favor of Defender. To make the transition as smooth as possible, we've developed an onboarding assistant to help you with just a few clicks. To use the assistant, click https://defender.openzeppelin.com/v2/#/overview?onboarding=true[here, window=_blank], log in with our account, and follow the steps. You can find the FAQ xref:faq.adoc[here].

=== Admin / Create Timelock → Deprecated

You can then import it to Defender using the `Address Book`. Learn more xref:guide/timelock-roles.adoc[here].
