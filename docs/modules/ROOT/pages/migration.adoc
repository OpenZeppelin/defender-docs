= Migrating from Defender 1.0

IMPORTANT: *On May 21st 2024, you will no longer have access to Defender 1.0 UI and API*. 

With the announcement of Defender 2.0 general availability, we are deprecating Defender 1.0 in favor of Defender 2.0. To make the transition as smooth as possible, we've developed an upgrade assistant to help you upgrade with just a few clicks. To use the assistant, navigate to Defender 1.0 https://defender.openzeppelin.com/#/[here, window=_blank], log in with our account, and follow the steps. You can find the FAQ xref:faq.adoc[here].

You can then import it to Defender using the Address Book. Learn more xref:guide/timelock-roles.adoc[here].
