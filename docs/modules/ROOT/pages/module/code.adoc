== Installation

[NOTE]
Installation must be initiated from Defender. Installing the app directly from GitHub will not correctly set up the integration.

The installation process connects your Defender account and your GitHub repositories. Follow the following steps:

. Navigate to the https://defender.openzeppelin.com/v2/#/code[Code Inspector page, window=_blank] on Defender.
. Click on the Install Code Inspector button, which redirects you to Github.
. Select and approve the repositories to install the app.
. Generate your first report by creating or updating a pull request on a repository that has the app installed.

The installation is currently done solely through Defender, ensuring a seamless connection for the reports. Following the installation, no additional setup is required. If you encounter installation issues, refer to our <<installation-issues,Troubleshooting>> section for guidance.

[[usage]]
== Usage

Code Inspector is designed to streamline your code analysis workflow. Once installed, the app is triggered whenever a pull request (PR) is opened or a new commit is pushed to an existing PR in your GitHub repository. To avoid skipping the report, the PR must contain at least a modification to any Solidity file or the `package.json` file.

The app automatically generates a summary report for each new commit, which is posted as a comment in your PR. This summary report is continuously updated with the latest issues discovered in the most recent commit, and the commit hash is directly viewable in the report.

Along with the summary reports in PR comments, a detailed report for each commit is created and can be accessed on Defender, offering in-depth information on the identified issues and how to fix them.

If you wish to stop receiving reports for a specific repository, it's as simple as navigating to the Code Inspector settings and removing the respective repository from the list.

=== Statuses
These are the possible statuses of reports:

* `Running`: The report has been triggered, and it's running.
* `Succeeded`: The report has been successfully generated, and it's available in Defender and Github.
* `Failed`: The report has failed. Make sure that your repository contains valid Solidity files. If this issue persists, please get in touch.
* `Throttled`: The report has been throttled as your tenant exceeded the Code Inpsector quota limit. If you would like to increase your quota, please get in touch.
* `Skipped`: The report has been skipped. Check that the PR and/or commit contains at least one modification to a Solidity file or the `package.json` file.

[[issues]]
=== Issues

Full reports identify issues within your smart contracts using a broad range of rules. The rules cover many aspects, such as known vulnerabilities, best practices, code efficiency, and secure coding principles.

image::contract-inspector-detailed-report.png[Full Report 1]

Each issue is assigned a severity level based on the potential impact on the contract's functionality and security. An explanation accompanies each flagged issue, articulating the reason for the concern.

Every issue has a suggested resolution tailored to improving your code quality and overall security. This might include recommendations to refine your code, modify visibility scopes, apply necessary mathematical checks, enhance documentation, or adhere to a specific Ethereum standard.

Depicted below is an example of a vulnerability detected in a dependency with a brief description of its potential impact. The specific dependency and its version are outlined, pinpointing where the problem exists. 

image::dependency-checker-detailed-report.png[Dependency Checker Report]

To help you resolve these issues, recommendations on updates or patches that can address the vulnerabilities are provided along with the relevant advisory links for a more detailed understanding of the issue.

By reviewing and applying the proposed solutions in this report, you can enhance the robustness and reliability of your smart contracts, ensuring adherence to best practices and industry standards. This makes the audit process smoother and improves the preparedness of your contracts for successful deployment.

[[standards]]
=== Standards

This feature introduces a new section in the report called **Standards**. This section provides insights into your contracts that implement interfaces from the OpenZeppelin Contracts library. For example, if you are using an `IERC20`, Code Inspector will check the implementation details and properties to ensure you are using this ERC correctly.

#### Detailed Checks

For each function and event defined in an interface, Code Inspector performs comprehensive checks to verify compliance with the standard. These checks include:

- **Signature:** Ensures that the function or event signature matches the standard's specification. Example: `transfer(address,uint256)`
- **Visibility:** Checks that the visibility of functions and events adheres to the standard's requirements. Example: `external`, `public`
- **Mutability:** For functions, ensures that the mutability is correctly specified as per the standard. Example: `view`, `pure`
- **Return Type:** Verifies that the return types of functions align with the expected types defined in the standard. Example `returns (bool)`
- **Parameter Names:** Confirms that the parameter names are consistent with those defined in the standard, enhancing code readability and maintainability. Example: `transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount)`
- **Return Names:** Ensures that the return variable names, where used, are consistent with the standard. Example: `returns (bool success)`

If any attribute of a function or event fails, the entire function or event is marked as failed. Additionally, if any function or event within an implementation fails, the entire implementation is considered non-compliant.

[[configuration]]
== Configuration

You can configure repository-specific parameters for Code Inspector using a file called `defender.config.json` in the root directory. The structure of the file is separated into processes run by Code Inspector. Each process has a list of parameters that you can adjust to your needs. For example, you can specify which directories to scan, which is useful to prevent Code Inspector from analyzing test or script files written in Solidity.

=== Contract Inspector
Contract Inspector runs a xref:#rules[set of rules] to detect potential issues in your code. You can configure the following parameters:

- `enabled`:  ability to turn off the Contract Inspector. False meaning not to run, and true to run. (default: `true`)
- `scan_directories`: list of directories to scan with paths starting from the root directory. default: `["."]`
- `include_rules`: list of rules to run. default: xref:#rules[all rules].
- `exclude_rules`: list of rules to not run. default: none.

=== Dependency Checker
Dependency Checker verifies that your dependencies are not vulnerable to known issues. You can configure the following parameters:

- `enabled`:  ability to turn off Dependency Checker. False meaning not to run, and true to run. (default: `true`)

==== Example

The following `defender.config.json` configuration file will disable Dependency Checker and run Contract Inspector on the `src/contracts1` and `src/contracts2` directories, excluding two rules (`naming-convention` and `unused-state`).

[source,json]
----
{
    "contract_inspector": {
        "enabled": true,
        "scan_directories": ["src/contracts1", "src/contracts2"],
        "exclude_rules": ["naming-convention", "unusued-state"]
    },
    "dependency_checker": {
        "enabled": false
    }
}
----

[[assets]]
== Assets

The Assets page allows you to manage your Code Inspector assets, supporting two types: Smart Contracts and GitHub repositories. When you install the Code Inspector GitHub app and select repositories, they will appear on this page. Additionally, you can create Smart Contract assets from addresses in your address book. Note that Smart Contract assets must be verified on Etherscan for this feature to work.

Smart Contract assets can be manually triggered for reports on the report page. GitHub assets can be triggered manually and automatically from new pull requests (PRs) and commits.

image::code-assets.png[Code Assets]

[[asset-settings]]
=== Settings

The Asset Settings page offers two main settings to manage how Defender handles asset security: Automatically Generate Report and Vulnerability Detection.

==== Automatically Trigger Report for Pull Requests

Automatically Generate Report, is specifically for GitHub repositories. When enabled, this setting ensures continuous monitoring by generating new reports automatically whenever a new pull request (PR) is opened or a new commit is pushed to a PR. 

==== Active Vulnerability Detection and Notification

Active Vulnerability Detection and Notification provides a robust security measure by automatically scanning your assets for new vulnerabilities.
This setting is applicable to both GitHub repositories and smart contracts. To enable this feature for Github repositories assets, you must activate the setting and select a specific branch to be monitored.

* *Automated Scanning*: Leveraging Defender's advanced smart contracts scanning capabilities, when our team becomes aware of a new vulnerability, whether disclosed or undisclosed, we promptly update our scanning algorithms to detect it. We then scan all assets configured to be monitored
* *Automated Notification*: Once the automatic scanning is completed an automated system notification email will be sent to inform you whether the vulnerability was detected in your monitored assets. If detected, the notifications include relevant information tailored to the nature of the vulnerability.
* *Risk Mitigation*: When detected, to aid in addressing and mitigating detected vulnerabilities, notifications may include suggestions for risk mitigation, providing actionable steps for administrators to protect their smart contracts and associated assets.

By enabling Active Vulnerability Detection and Notification for your assets, you can benefit from continuous, automated scanning and timely notifications, empowering you to respond quickly to new threats and maintain the security of your smart contracts and GitHub repositories. This proactive approach ensures that you can stay ahead of potential vulnerabilities and safeguard your code effectively.


[[settings]]
== Settings

The Settings page allows you to manage the permissions and access level of the Code Inspector. If you need to make changes to the repositories that the app has access to, a convenient link takes you directly to the GitHub settings page of the app, facilitating effortless repository management.

In the Github tab, you can globally suspend or uninstall the app, giving you complete control over its operation within your projects.

[[troubleshooting]]
== Troubleshooting

[[installation-issues]]
=== Installation Issues

* *Installing the app outside Defender*: Code Inspector must be installed via Defender. If you attempt to install it from elsewhere, the installation will not succeed. Ensure you're logged in to your OpenZeppelin account and navigate to Code Inspector from Defender for a successful installation.

* *Code Inspector Access*: Access to Code Inspector is required for a successful installation. If you find that you don't have access and you think this is a mistake, contact OpenZeppelin support to get the necessary permissions.

[[repo-size-issues]]
=== Repository Size Issues

Errors related to analysis timeouts are often caused by large codebases. To mitigate this issue, it is recommended to use the `scan_directories` option in the defender configuration file to scope the analysis to relevant files only. By specifying which directories to include in the scan, the configuration file can significantly reduce processing times and prevent timeouts. For detailed instructions on setting up the configuration file, please refer to the xref:module/code.adoc#configuration[Configuration] section.
