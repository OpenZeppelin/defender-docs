= Billing Role

The Billing Role feature allows you to manage access to the Billing section of the platform, ensuring that only authorized users can view or modify financial data. Admin users can define custom billing permissions for each team member, limiting access to billing functionality based on specific roles such as "Manage Billing" or "Read Only."

== Billing Roles and Permissions

The platform allows Admins to assign billing-related permissions to users. The available options are "Manage Billing," "Read Only," and "No Access." These permissions can be customized during role creation, ensuring that users have appropriate access to billing information.

The Billing Role is structured as follows:

* **Manage Billing**: Grants full control over billing settings, including the ability to modify payment methods, view transaction details, and manage subscriptions.
* **Read Only**: Allows users to view billing details, invoices, and payment history without making any changes.
* **No Access**: Users with this permission cannot view or interact with any billing-related information.

To assign billing permissions, Admins can navigate to the Roles page and select the desired level of access for the user.

Once assigned, the billing role permissions will determine what actions users can perform within the Billing section of the platform.

The Billing UI is divided into several sections:

[[conclusion]]
== Conclusion

The introduction of the Billing Role allows flexibility and control over who can access and modify billing information on the platform. By assigning permissions based on user roles, Admins can ensure that only authorized personnel manage financial data, while team members with limited access can still view the information they need to perform their duties.
