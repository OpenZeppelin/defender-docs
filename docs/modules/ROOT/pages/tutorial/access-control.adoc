# Modify and assign roles in a role-based access control smart contract

Defender allows you to seamlessly oversee and command contract permissions on a grand scale, with the power to view and control access at a granular level. This tutorial shows how to add a smart contract to see and manage its roles, including assigning and removing roles.

[[pre-requisites]]
== Pre-requisites

* OpenZeppelin Defender account. You can sign up to Defender https://defender.openzeppelin.com/v2/?utm_campaign=Defender_2.0_2023&utm_source=Docs#/auth/sign-up[here, window=_blank].
* Any external wallet (like Metamask) with an EOA that holds funds in Sepolia.

== 1. Add contract

NOTE: For this tutorial, you will create a contract that implements the role-based Access Control library using https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xF909B3dBB525fDe7C3e8cd59FbECF3D42c217454[this, window=_blank] factory deployed to Sepolia. Your created contract will automatically assign you the admin role to manage its roles.

. Open the Defender https://defender.openzeppelin.com/v2/#/address-book/new[Address Book, window=_blank] in a web browser.
. Fill the form with the following values and click `Create`:
+
* Name: `Access Control Factory`
* Network: `Sepolia`
* Address: `0xF909B3dBB525fDe7C3e8cd59FbECF3D42c217454`

+

. Navigate to https://defender.openzeppelin.com/v2/#/transaction-proposals/new?[Transaction Proposals, window=_blank].
. Fill the **General Information** section with the following values:
+
* Name: `Create Access Control contract`
* Target contract: `Access Control Factory`

+
image::tutorial-access-control-tx-general.png[Transaction Proposal general information]

. For the **Function** section, select the `create` function.
. Open the **Approval Process** section, click the input field and select `Create Approval Process`.
. Fill the approval process form with the following values and click `Save Changes`:
+
* Name: `Access Control Admin`
* Type: `EOA`
* Address: _Your wallet EOA address_

. Connect your wallet with the EOA address of the approval process created and click `Submit Transaction Proposal`.
+

. Click on the `Create Access Control contract` transaction proposal.
. Click the top-right button `Approve and Execute` and confirm the transaction on your wallet.
+

. Scroll down and under **Execution Result**, hover over the first contract to copy its address.
+

. Navigate to the Defender https://defender.openzeppelin.com/v2/#/address-book/new Address Book, window=_blank] to add your newly created contract.
. Fill the form with the following values and click `Create`:
+
* Name: `Access Control Contract`
* Network: `Sepolia`
* Address: _Contract address copied from the previous steps_
* ABI: _Copy and paste the following_

. Navigate to the https://defender.openzeppelin.com/v2/#/access-control/contracts[Access Control page, window=_blank].
. Observe your newly added contract with the number addresses that hold the admin role.

. Click on the contract card.

== 2. View and modify roles

In your contract-specific page, you can see the addresses that hold the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` role, which is the EOA address from the approval process you used to deploy the contract. To make a change, click on the role and input the new address (or remove one address if you want to remove it from the role). Follow these steps to add a new address to the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`:

. Click on the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` role.
. Select any address from the dropdown menu or add a new one.
. Scroll down and click on `Select an Approval Process`.
. Select your `Access Control Admin` approval process.
. Check that your wallet is connected with the right EOA address. If not, click on the button below the field to connect your wallet.
. Click on `Save Changes` and confirm the transaction on your wallet.
. Wait for the transaction to get executed and check that the new address holds the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` role.

For ownable contracts, you can only make changes to the `Owner` role using an approval process that matches the current owner's address. When using a multisig as approval process, you will see the pending proposals on the right side of the page. 

The page sync every minute, and updates when modifying a role.

== Next steps

Congratulations! You can import other contracts and modify their roles.

NOTE: After configuring Access Control, we recommend seting up Workflows. Learn how to use Workflows with its tutorial xref::tutorial/workflows.adoc[here].
