# Using Relayer for Sending Transactions

In this tutorial, we will explore how to use the xref::manage.adoc#relayers[Relayer] to send transactions. We will cover:

* Checking relayer information.
* Sending a transaction.
* Checking the relayer status.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a basic understanding of how to use the Relayer to interact with smart contracts.

[[pre-requisites]]
== Pre-requisites

* OpenZeppelin Defender account. You can sign up to Defender https://defender.openzeppelin.com/v2/?utm_campaign=Defender_2.0_2023&utm_source=Docs#/auth/sign-up[here, window=_blank].
* https://nodejs.org/en[NodeJS and NPM, window=_blank]
* https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node[Typescript for Node js, window=_blank]
* Any IDE or text editor

[[Set-Up-Relayer]]
== 1. Set Up Relayer

Let's start by creating a Relayer:

* Open https://defender.openzeppelin.com/v2/#/relayers[Defender Operate & Automate] in a web browser.
+
image::tutorial-relayer-step1.png[Manage Relayer]
* Click on *Create Relayer* with the name ETH Sepolia Relayer and Sepolia network.
+
image::tutorial-relayer-step2.png[Create Relayer]
* Fund it with some Sepolia ETH. This relayer will send and pay for the automated transactions.
* To create an API key for a Relayer, click on the Relayer and then on the *More* button to expand the dropdown and select *Create API Key*
+
image::tutorial-relayer-step3.png[Create Relayer API]
* Now you can set API key expiration in minutes, hours or days.
+

* Once the API Key is created, make sure to write down the secret key. The API secret is only visible once during the creation — if you don’t write it down, it’s lost forever.

[[Check-Relayer-Information]]
== 2. Check Relayer Information

*  Let's start by checking the information of our relayer.
*  Add Relayer in `.env` File
*  Edit `.env` file in your project root directory and add your Relayer API Key and Secret:
+
[source,jsx]
----
RELAYER_API_KEY=your_api_key
RELAYER_SECRET_KEY=your_api_secret
----

* Create a file named `storeObject.ts` in the project. 
* Now let’s add the following code:
+
[source,jsx]
----
const { Defender } = require('@openzeppelin/defender-sdk');

const dotenv = require('dotenv');

dotenv.config();

async function main() {

const client = new Defender({

relayerApiKey: process.env.RELAYER_API_KEY,
relayerApiSecret: process.env.RELAYER_SECRET_KEY,
});

const info = await client.relaySigner.getRelayer();
console.log('Relayer Info:', JSON.stringify(info, null, 2));

}

main().catch((error) => {
console.error(error);
process.exitCode = 1;
});

----

* Execute the script to check the relayer information:
+
[source,jsx]
----
ts-node storeObject.ts
----

[[Send-Transaction]]
== 3. Send Transaction

Next, we will send a transaction using the relayer. 

* Let’s edit the same file and add the following code:
+
[source,jsx]
----
const tx = await client.relaySigner.sendTransaction({
    to: '0x1B9ec5Cc45977927fe6707f2A02F51e1415f2052',
    speed: 'fast',
    data: '0x6057361d000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a',
    gasLimit: '80000',
  });
console.log('Transaction sent! Hash:', tx.hash);
----

Here we are using the Sepolia https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x1B9ec5Cc45977927fe6707f2A02F51e1415f2052[Box contract] as the target, which is:
[source,jsx]
----
0x1B9ec5Cc45977927fe6707f2A02F51e1415f2052
----

and data is the encoded version of the store() function with ‘10’ as input parameter.
[source,jsx]
----
0x6057361d000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a
----

* Execute the script to send a transaction:
+
[source,jsx]
----
ts-node storeObject.ts
----

[[Check-Transaction-Status]]
== 4. Check Transaction Status

Finally, let's check the status of our transaction status.

* Edit the file again and add the following code:
+
[source,jsx]
----
const txUpdate = await client.relaySigner.getTransaction(tx.transactionId);
console.log('Tx Status', JSON.stringify(txUpdate, null, 2));
----

* Execute the script to check the relayer status:
+
[source,jsx]
----
ts-node storeObject.ts
----
