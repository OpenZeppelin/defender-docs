# Monitor a smart contract for on-chain activity 

Defender 2.0 allows you to monitor smart contract transactions and events across chains. This tutorial shows how to build a customized Monitor template and use it in a real-world context to monitor a https://uniswap.org/[Uniswap V2, window=_blank] pool.

[[pre-requisites]]
== Pre-requisites

* OpenZeppelin Defender 2.0 account. You can create an account for free https://defender.openzeppelin.com/v2/[here, window=_blank].

NOTE: Learn to deploy contracts to monitor using Defender 2.0 xref::tutorial/deploy.adoc[here]!

[[configure]]
== 1. Configure the monitor

You will monitor the `0xB4e16d0168e52d35CaCD2c6185b44281Ec28C9Dc` contract in the Ethereum mainnet, which is the https://etherscan.io/address/0xB4e16d0168e52d35CaCD2c6185b44281Ec28C9Dc[Uniswap V2 USDC-ETH pool, window=_blank]. This contract has constant activity, making it a good candidate to see how quick monitors are. To configure a monitor, follow these steps:

. Open https://defender.openzeppelin.com/v2/#/monitor[Defender 2.0 Monitor, window=_blank] in a web browser.
. Click on *Create Monitor*.

. Name this monitor as `Uniswap V2: USDC-ETH Monitor`.
. Select the `Financial` risk category.
. Click the *Contracts* field and select to add a new address.
. Fill the form with the following parameters and select it as contract to monitor:

+
* Name: `Uniswap V2: USDC-ETH Pool`
* Network: `Mainnet`
* Address: `0xB4e16d0168e52d35CaCD2c6185b44281Ec28C9Dc`

. Select `1 confirmation block`. Defender 2.0 will automatically pick up the ABI, so we can select the transaction filters next.

. Add the `status == "success"` parameter to *Transaction Properties* to filter by transaction-level data and confirm transactions are successfully confirmed and not reverted.

+

. Select the `Swap` event from the dropdown menu. This event is emitted every time a swap is made in the pool.

+

. Skip function-level filters as you are already tracking all `Swap` events emitted from the contract. 
. Select the `High Severity` notification category, tied to a channel of your choice (such as email).
. Click on *Save Monitor*.

Your monitor is now running!

[[receive-alerts]]
== 2. Receive alerts

Alerts will start rolling in as long as the monitor is active. Your notifications should look like this if you selected email as the notification channel:

You can pause or delete monitors on the https://defender.openzeppelin.com/v2/#/monitor[Defender 2.0 Monitor, window=_blank] page. This one will trigger frequently so you will likely want to pause it using the toggle on the right after you receive a couple of alerts. You can also save a monitor as a template by clicking on the dotted icon of its card and `Save as Template`.

== Next steps

Congratulations! You can modify the monitor to filter for specific `Swap` data or target another pool. In case you are interested in advanced use cases, we are working on monitor-related guides.

NOTE: After setting up a monitor, we recommend creating Actions on Defender 2.0. Learn how to use Actions with its tutorial xref::tutorial/actions.adoc[here].
